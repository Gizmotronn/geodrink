Things we want
General
rules
settings - dark mode - sound effects - other shit
perhaps a paid version with no ads - maybe not until it's properly set up
fun facts about weather on loading screens and home screen
notifications (can turn on and off ) - reminders for daily games - people beating scores on leaderboards etc.

single player
easy, medium and hard modes
kahoot based scoring - accuracy and speed taken into account
some kind of daily game? 5 different cities each day - ranked leaderboard?
hints for single player only - points deducted if you use a hint scoring system
Can watch an ad to get a hint - can bank hints too so you can store them up
Need to decide how many questions per round - 10
Points system:
10 = perfect
7 = within 2 degrees
5 = within 5 degrees
2 = within 7 degrees?
If there's a local leaderboard / other leaderboard - have the option for people to have profiles with custom profile pics - different weather types? - some kind of avatars

Multiplayer
Drink and non-drink mode? - (I imagine anyone doing multiplayer is only doing so if they're drinking but you never know)
maybe an option to input players names - some indication of who is getting asked the question (or for DIY mode who asks who the question) - i.e. Matt's turn, then Liam's turn (or matt asks liam, next round says Liam asks Soroush etc.)
easy, medium, hard, DIY mode
DIY mode where people can pick their own cities 
More basic, keep it to within 2 degrees C or ~4 degrees F
confirmation of either correct or not - prompt to drink - either the person answering drinks or everyone else drinks
